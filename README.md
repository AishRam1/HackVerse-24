Trial to implement blockchain technology

Implementing a rough framework of a blockchain technology and show it in a secure way. 
The "app.py" file is supposed to work as the frontend for the application. It is mainly deployed to implement for the RAA field (Robust Asset Allocation). 
The "end.py" file has the necessary functions and hashing algorithms along with flask connectivity. It also shows the timestamp, previous hash keys and current hash keys of the transactions being made. 
The "contract_abi.json" file has the necessary smart contracts which is used from an open source library since creating it or rendering it was beyond the scope for the given time.
The initial idea was to implement the "encryption-decryption" kind of security into the smart contracts transactions but the integration of both frontend and backend posed constant errors throughout. 

NOTE: Create a folder called "templates" and upload the .html files into that to see the rudimentary frontend for the application.
